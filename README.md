## üìù Project Description

The ASCII Art Generator is a Python-based program that dynamically converts user-provided text into side-by-side aligned ASCII art. It supports:
- lowercase letters (`a-z`).
- Numbers (`0-9`).
- Special characters such as spaces, `!`, `.`, ` ` and `?`.

This project is perfect for learning basic Python scripting, handling dynamic input, and creating engaging visual outputs. It‚Äôs also a great tool for generating ASCII art for fun or creative purposes.
